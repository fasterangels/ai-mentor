# v0.3.0 — Planning

**Status:** Planning only. No code or CI changes in this doc.

---

## In-scope (features)

- **Evaluation visibility:** Expose analyzer/evaluation KPIs or history in the desktop UI (read-only; backend already has `/api/v1/evaluation/*`).
- **Result export:** Allow exporting the canonical result (e.g. PDF or copy-friendly summary) from the Result view.
- **Settings surface:** Simple in-app settings (e.g. analyzer version v1/v2, window defaults) persisted locally; no new backend endpoints required for initial set.
- **UX polish:** Keyboard shortcuts, accessibility tweaks, and minor layout/feedback improvements on top of v0.2.x.

---

## Out-of-scope

- New analyzer logic or new markets.
- CORS or build/packaging changes (unless required for a listed feature).
- Linux/macOS builds or installers (document as future; no implementation in v0.3.0).
- Backend API breaking changes; additive only.

---

## Risks & guardrails (no regressions)

- **Canary and contract:** All changes must keep `canary-preflight` and contract-lock tests passing; no removal or weakening of existing guardrails.
- **E2E:** Windows E2E (install → task → /health → POST /analyze) must remain green; new UI/features must not break the existing flow.
- **Artifact invariants:** CI artifact checks (ci_build_stdout.txt, backend.log, NSIS installer) stay in place and must pass.
- **v1 analyzer:** v1 path remains supported and default where applicable; v2 is opt-in or config.

---

## Success criteria

- v0.3.0 Windows installer builds and passes full E2E.
- At least one “evaluation visibility” or “result export” capability shipped and usable from the desktop.
- No regressions in health, OPTIONS/analyze, or analyze response contract.
- README and rollback procedure still accurate.

## Milestones (BLOCK-based)

| BLOCK   | Focus                         | Outcome |
|---------|--------------------------------|---------|
| BLOCK 1 | Evaluation visibility          | UI can show evaluation KPIs or history from existing API. |
| BLOCK 2 | Result export                  | User can export result (e.g. PDF or summary) from Result view. |
| BLOCK 3 | Settings surface               | In-app settings (analyzer version, window defaults) with local persistence. |
| BLOCK 4 | UX polish & wrap               | Shortcuts, a11y/layout tweaks; final smoke pass and release cut. |

Order may be adjusted; BLOCK 1 and 2 can be parallelized if resources allow.
